    "In scikit-learn, the Pipeline and ColumnTransformer classes offer an idiomatic and streamlined way to chain multiple preprocessing steps and a model into a single workflow. The `Pipeline` class allows you to assemble sequences of transformations and a final model, which simplifies your code and helps prevent common mistakes, such as fitting preprocessing steps to the test data. The `ColumnTransformer` is particularly useful for applying different preprocessing to different columns, such as one-hot encoding for categorical variables and scaling for numerical variables. By combining these tools, you not only reduce the need for manual 'glue' code but also safeguard against the leakage of information from the test set into the training process.

    "* Compute both the MAE and the RMSE. \n",
    "* The one you should focus on the most is typically the RMSE. \n",
    "* If there are error outliers then the difference between the MAE and the RMSE is likely going to be large. In that case it is typically more interesting to look at the MAE. \n",
    " \n",
    "Typically, RMSE is preferred because it is more sensitive to large errors, which can be critical in applications where such errors are especially problematic, like in autonomous vehicle guidance systems. However, if your model is prone to outliers, or if large errors are less impactful, MAE can be a more relevant metric. Always consider the specific context of your application when choosing your primary evaluation metric."
