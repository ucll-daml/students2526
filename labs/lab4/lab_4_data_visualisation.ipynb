    "   - **Who it's for**: A wider audience, which could include stakeholders, team members, or anyone who needs to understand the main takeaways.\n",

    "2. **Overlapping Data Points**: If you're interested in seeing where data points from different categories intersect or overlap, using color on a single plot can be very effective.\n",
